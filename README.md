# University Project ‚Äì Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (C++ & Java)
This repository contains a group project I took part in during my Bachelor's degree, marking my first hands-on experience with object-oriented programming.

As part of the project, we developed:

üè≠ A warehouse management system in C++

‚ô†Ô∏è A graphical Poker game in Java

The project provided a solid foundation in object-oriented design principles and practical experience in building structured, multi-component applications in both C++ and Java.
